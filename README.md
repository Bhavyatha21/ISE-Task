Pharmacy Management System – SDLC Analysis
Project Overview

This repository contains the Software Engineering assignment report for the course Introduction to Software Engineering (IS1103-1).

The project is based on the analysis and comparison of SDLC models using a Pharmacy Management System (PMS) as a case study.

The main focus of the report is to evaluate:
1.Waterfall Model
2.Incremental Model
3.Spiral Model

And determine which model is most suitable for developing a mid-sized pharmacy management system.

Branching and Merging Strategy
This repository follows a simple branching strategy to simulate real-world software development practices.

Branches Used
1.main
Contains the final approved version of the report.
Stable and ready for submission.

2.dev
Used to make edits and improvements to the document before final approval.
Changes were tested and reviewed in this branch.

Workflow Followed
1.The repository was initialized with a main branch.
2.The initial report file was added.
3.A new branch named dev was created for editing and refinement.
4.Modifications were made in the dev branch.
5.A Pull Request was created to merge changes into main.
6.After review, the dev branch was merged into main.

This ensured that the main branch always remained clean and stable.

Purpose of Using Branching
The branching strategy was used to:
1.Prevent direct modification of the final document
2.Maintain clear history of changes
3.Demonstrate version control practice
4.Simulate professional software project workflow

Conclusion

This repository demonstrates how version control concepts such as branching and merging can be applied even in documentation-based software engineering projects.
